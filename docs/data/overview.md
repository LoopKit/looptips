# Loop Data

In order to assess your Loop's performance and more specifically your settings, having access to your historical data trends is invaluable. Seeing what your Loop was predicting, what actions were being taken, how blood glucose was reacting, and how insulin needs have been changing is critical when trying to assess any settings changes.

## Problem with traditional methods

When you go to your endocrinology office, they need to have a method to view all your Automated Insulin Delivery system data in one place.

* If you use an Omnipod Eros or DASH pump - there is no PDM for your clinic to read insulin dosing records
* If you use a Medtronic pump, the memory is full of the many commands sent from Loop

## Available solutions for DIY apps

The good news is that the community has some very useful tools to help address the shortcomings in the traditional data aggregation for Loop users. There are several tools available to help you and/or your endocrinologist evaluate your Loop data. Specifically, this section covers:
