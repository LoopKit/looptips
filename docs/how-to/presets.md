# Presets

Your Loop has a built-in preset you can activate: *`Pre-meal`*.   
You can also define custom presets, like a *Workout* preset.

When activated, a preset will "override" or take the place of your usual correction range, affecting Loop's insulin delivery decisions.

## Configuring the Pre-Meal Preset

You can set the value for this *pre-meal* preset from the Correction Range area of *Loop* settings. Generally speaking, the *Pre-meal*  is set to value(s) lower than your correction range. 

## Activating the Pre-Meal Preset

You can activate the `Pre-Meal` preset by pressing the icon that looks like a timer :material-camera-timer: between a f&#8203;ork and a knife :fontawesome-solid-utensils:.

It  will stay active for:  

* one hour, or
* until carbs are entered, or 
* until the pre-meal preset is manually cancelled by pressing the icon again.

*Pre-meal* preset will automatically end when one of those three things happens, whichever comes first will end the pre-meal preset.

!!! info "How to tell if a preset is active?"
     *Loop* will indicate that a Preset is active by showing a darker blue bar on the blood glucose chart showing the duration and location of the target.
 
The original intent of the pre-meal preset was to help give a gentle, easy pre-bolus effect to help lessen a post-meal blood glucose spike. By lowering your Loop's target going into a meal, you can get a "pre-bolus" effect because Loop will aim for that lower target and thus tend to set a little more aggressive insulin delivery while the target is active. Loop will recognize the "extra" insulin that has been delivered while pre-meal is active, and Loop will smartly take that into account when it is finally time to recommend a bolus at meal entry time.

*Pre-meal* preset won't replace the utility of a true pre-bolus in most situations, but it can be useful in many situations beyond simply helping meals. This lower target can help Loop be more aggressive:

* During stressful events where adrenaline might be causing increased blood glucose
* During exercise that may tend to increase blood glucose
* During illness that is causing high blood glucose


## Creating a Custom Preset

You can also [create a custom override preset](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/operation/features/overrides/#create-an-override-preset){: target="_blank" } (like `Workout`, for instance) by pressing the blue heart pulse icon :material-heart-pulse:.
When activated, your `Workout` Preset could set a target greater than your usual correction range for a specific duration to help in situations where *Loop* needs to be less aggressive with insulin delivery
The most common use of a *Workout* Preset is to set it in advance and during exercise to help minimize IOB going into a workout. 
There are other times when it can be helpful, such as:

- Helping to recover from low blood glucose treatment
- Helping after workouts when still experiencing increased insulin sensitivity
- Helping during illness which tends to lower blood glucose or increase insulin sensitivity
