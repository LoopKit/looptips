Each day people with T1D make decisions about what and when to eat, and how much insulin to use to cover carbohydrates effect. It can be difficult to visualize what is happening throughout the day as carbohydrate absorption raises blood glucose and insulin reduces it \u2013 particularly when multiple events interact with one another.</p> <p>GlucoDyn uses calculations similar to an insulin pump\u2019s bolus wizard to create graphs of blood glucose versus time, based on your inputs of carb and insulin events. The user can enter carbohydrates, boluses, and temporary basals, and GlucoDyn calculates the effect on blood glucose over time. GlucoDyn also allows the user to \u201cslide\u201d the events around once they have been entered \u2013 allowing you to see what would have happened to your blood glucose curve if you had bolused earlier or eaten a different amount of carbohydrates \u201con the fly\u201d \u2013 the curves change as you move the sliders.</p> <p>Seeing the curves and understanding the effects of bolus timing, carbohydrate absorption rate glycemic index (GI) value, temporary basal timing and rates, etc. can help users with their overall understanding of T1D and its management.</p> <p>Originally, Loop used the same carbohydrate absorption and insulin models as Glucodyn uses. Those have since been updated in Loop with dynamic carbohydrate absorption and exponential curves for insulin. Even with those changes, the GlucoDyn tool can still provide users an excellent tool to visualize how small changes in bolusing can affect trends in blood glucose. For example, it\u2019s quite interesting to see the effect of pre-bolusing. By delaying the carb intake by say 20 minutes, you can visualize the reduction of the maximum blood glucose. But, you have to be careful \u2013 before the carbohydrates have time to absorb insulin is working, and the minimum blood glucose will also drop. These are the kinds of tradeoffs that are critical to the management of T1D, and thankfully are automated by Loop's smart bolusing based on carbohydrate absorption estimates.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"data/health/","title":"Health App","text":""},{"location":"data/health/#overview-of-healthkit-and-health","title":"Overview of HealthKit and Health","text":"<p>There's often confusion over the terminology surrounding Apple's health data storage so let's start there.</p> <ul> <li>HealthKit -- Apple's iOS database for storing health-related data.

Complex carbohydrates are slowed by their fat and protein content and can lead to extended time of blood glucose impacts. Many people with type 1 are familiar with the late blood glucose spikes from Chinese food, pasta, pizza, or burritos. This extended blood glucose impact can be tricky to properly bolus for in traditional one-bolus insulin delivery.</p> <p>In traditional multiple daily injection therapy, these complex meals may require additional insulin boluses to help control long, slow absorption meals. The trick is to try to time the second bolus at a time when blood glucose is starting to rise and it can be tricky to estimate how much to give to control the tail end of those slow meals.</p> <p>If you're using traditional pump therapy, one technique is to use an extended bolus or dual wave bolus for your complex meal's insulin. In this method, a user give a portion of the insulin up front as an initial bolus and the remainder of the insulin is delivered as a pseudo high temp basal for a user-set duration of time. For example, you may give 5 units of bolus up-front and then \"extend\" 4 units of insulin over the next 60 minutes. In this way, you are providing a more complex bolus to help match the timing of the meal's blood glucose impacts; avoiding early low blood glucose and addressing later high blood glucose.</p> <p>The transition to Loop use may be confusing at first for these meals since you cannot use an extended/combo bolus and simultaneously have Loop set temporary basals automatically. The good news is that Loop has a bolus calculator that has the ability to emulate an extended bolus situation...and it's implemented with the pizza icon (or any custom carbohydrate absorption that is set longer than 4 hours).</p>"},{"location":"how-to/bolus/#pizza-icon","title":"Pizza Icon","text":""},{"location":"how-to/bolus/#example-long-absorption-time-bolus","title":"Example long absorption time bolus","text":"<p>For an example of  Loop's bolus adjustments using carbohydrate absorption time, let's take a look at an example meal.  This is an example of a long absorption complex carbohydrate meal. This is a mushroom (arborio) risotto dish with heavy cream and cheese ingredients. While some white rice can be fairly quick acting, after several times eating this dish, the family has noticed that the meal tends to have a longer duration of impact on blood glucose. Using a \"taco\" icon (3 hours absorption) was causing slight low blood glucose soon after eating the meal. Therefore, they have been using the pizza icon to enter the meal's carbohydrate absorption time.</p> <p></p> <p>The initial meal entry was 70g at a \"pizza\" icon absorption time (4 hours). Based on a carbohydrate ratio of 8 g/U, the initial bowl of risotto at 60g should have been a bolus of 7.5 units. Loop recommended 5.3 units or about 70% of the total bolus that would be needed to cover the total carbohydrates. Loop recommended the lower upfront bolus because a full bolus would have overwhelmed the slow absorption of carbohydrates, and the likelihood would be a low blood glucose shortly after eating. </p> <p>As the meal was being absorbed, Loop was tracking the carbohydrates still remaining to be absorbed and expecting that blood glucose values would be rising soon (knowing that there was still insulin needing to be delivered once safely passed the near-meal low blood glucose potential). Loop would have provided the additional insulin via high temporary basals after seeing blood glucose impacts which indicated the potential for a low blood glucose had passed. </p> <p>The Loop user then had a second, smaller bowl of risotto about 90 minutes later, and entered 30g at 4 hours absorption again. Notice this bowl of risotto had a bolus recommendation much different than the original bowl. The second bowl had a recommendation of 5 units, much greater amount of bolus relative to the amount of carbs entered than the first bowl had received, and more than the carbohydrate ratio alone would provide (3.75 units). Why the \"extra\" 1.25 units? Because Loop was including some extra bolus amount to cover what it predicted could safely be provided from the amount not given in the original bowl's bolus (the original bolus was approximately 2.2 units short of the carbohydrate ratio alone recommendation). If the user had not had the second bowl, Loop would have been providing high temporary basals as soon as blood glucose had exceeded the correction range. And in fact, you can see that Loop still provided the remaining insulin via high temporary basals as blood glucose rose after the second bowl, in effect making up the small remaining difference.</p>"},{"location":"how-to/bolus/#low-carbhigh-fat-or-keto-diets","title":"Low carb/High Fat or Keto diets","text":"<p>The example meal above, while relatively high carbohydrate, also helps illustrate how Loop can be used to bolus effectively for low carb/high fat (LC/HF) or Keto diets.  Those diets tend to have low glycemic index food with a relatively long blood glucose impact.  Said another way, they don't spike blood sugar as much but often need additional insulin after the meal was eaten to account for the slow conversion of protein to glucose.</p> <p>To account for those dietary differences, there are two useful strategies:</p> <ul> <li>convert some of the protein and fat to \"equivalent carbohydrates\" and</li> <li>extend the duration of those carbohydrates using a pizza icon or even longer, depending on the person/food.</li> </ul> <p>Most LC/HF or Keto users will convert a portion of their fat and protein content into an equivalent carbohydrate content.  So while an example meal might only have 5g of carbohydrates based on nutritional labels, they may convert 25% of the 20g fat and 50% of the 20g protein grams into an additional 15g of \"equivalent carbs\" for bolusing purposes.

The CGM noise immediately decreased after the first calibration was provided at the noon-time meal bolus. (Personally, we give the G6 one calibration point about 8-12 hours after a session starts because we have noticed that it helps settle down the noise quickly. This is not a part of the standard Dexcom protocols.)</p> <p>We similarly see an increase in sensor noise at the end of a sensor's useful life.

CGM data shows blood glucose dropping low, but finger checks on a meter would confirm that the CGM data is falsely low. Often, Dexcom G5 and G6 will stop providing CGM values for awhile when their algorithm detects a suspected compression low. Once the person rolls off the sensor area and blood starts flowing well again, the CGM values come back online to a more reasonable tracking again. </p> <p>Generally speaking, Loop will deal with compression lows just fine.

Showers, some sports activities, swimming, and medical exams are some of the common reasons when disconnections are unavoidable.</p> <p>The simplest way to deal with periods of disconnect is to suspend the pump so that Loop knows no insulin was being delivered while you were disconnected. This will let Loop know that there is missing basal insulin that may need to be considered as part of the blood glucose prediction. Typically when disconnected from insulin delivery and negative insulin on board has developed, blood glucose will start to rise so Loop will expect to need to make up the missed insulin from disconnections.</p> <p>Some users are prone to forget to resume insulin delivery after suspending for disconnects.  One option is to use Siri by simply saying \"Hey Siri, set a timer for 30 minutes\" and that can serve as a reminder alarm to resume the pump after the shower is over. Other users may want to consider canceling any running temporary basal, setting a 30 minute zero temporary basal, and then setting Loop to open loop.  This will keep IOB fairly accurate while at the same time providing an automatic restart of normal basals if the user forgets to resume delivery. The user will then have to close loop again when ready to resume looping. Find what option works for you (or your child) the best; there are a number of ways to deal with disconnects.</p> <p>For disconnects where the disconnected time coincides with exercise that may increase insulin sensitivity (like swimming), a good strategy after reconnecting can be to set a higher temporary override target (aka workout mode) for some time after reconnecting and resuming insulin delivery.  This will help Loop be a little gentler with high temporary basals during the time while the user is still experiencing increased insulin sensitivity after exercise.  The length of time to set that override target can be a bit of trial-and-error as it will depend on the person and type of exercise.</p>"},{"location":"how-to/endo/","title":"Endocrinologist and Loop","text":"<p>There is a wide range of comfort within the healthcare profession for DIY projects and type 1 diabetes.

The best approach is to start with objective information. Find out if the clinic has other patients already Looping and whether or not they have concerns from what they have seen. Provide links to the LoopDocs site and this site so that your endocrinologist or healthcare provider can read about the system's algorithm and operations.</p> <p>Most often the important aspects that need discussion are:</p> <ul> <li>Loop will revert to normal pump use, within a maximum of 30 minutes, in the event of Loop failure.  What happens during the failure of the system is the most common concern your healthcare provider will likely have when initially learning about the system.</li> <li>Loop depends on your basal rate, ISF, and carbohydrate ratio settings, just like traditional pump therapy. The conversations will not need to change regarding the evaluation and adequacy of those settings.</li> <li>Duration of insulin action is automatically set to 6 hours for the rapid-acting insulin models built into Loop, matching published data for those insulins. The settings in the pump for the duration of insulin action are not used by Loop.</li> <li>Reasonable values for the suspend threshold and maximum basal rate should be discussed.  These two settings are not part of normal pump therapy and should be discussed with your endocrinologist. Typically, to start Looping, setting the maximum basal rate not much above your highest scheduled basal rate is an excellent way to get used to Loop and safely double-check that your settings (ISF, carbohydrate ratio, and basal schedule) are reasonably accurate.  As you gain experience and confirm your settings, raising the maximum basal rate can help Loop become more effective in correcting rising blood glucose more quickly.</li> <li>Develop a plan for how you will be providing Loop data to your healthcare provider in advance.  Ask what information they would like to review so that you can have reports ready at each appointment. The usual download of a Medtronic pump or Omnipod PDM will not be sufficient for many clinics once you start Loop.  Instead, you may wish to discuss Nightscout or Tidepool data reports to provide the information those downloads would have otherwise provided.</li> <li>Develop a plan for how you will deal with pump failure.

Check if you are (1) above, below, or within correction range and (2) carrying significant positive or negative IOB in the morning before you start walking around (if you are prone to dawn phenomenon) or eating. Since mornings are free from food influence, these are almost like waking up from a mini-basal testing every overnight. </p> <p>This Looped group post started the conversation:</p> <p> </p> <p>I've been having more lows recently than I would like. Any help here would be really really appreciated.</p> <p>I took a screenshot of an example situation...LOOP is forecasting that I'll eventually rise up to 124 and is therefore giving me my full regular basal rate EVEN THOUGH im currently way below my desired goal range. I have a better knowledge of my diabetes than LOOP does (sorry if that is heresy around here) and I would not like LOOP to be giving me basal right now OR ELSE I'LL GO LOW.</p> <p>QUESTION: Which parameter must I change on my loop settings in order to essentially tell LOOP to relax on the basal rates??</p> <p></p> <p>To illustrate how to use morning IOB and blood glucose to check your basal rates, we will walk through a series of screenshots from a recent Loop experience. When the Looper woke up, she was below her 95 mg/dL target, but relatively steady. At about 8:48am, Nightscout showed negative IOB of -1.33 units, blood glucose of 90 mg/dL and slightly rising but still below a target of 95 mg/dL. (Note: this situation is similar to what the original Facebook poster above was describing.)</p> <p></p> <p>Looking back on the night, blood glucose was pretty much below target the whole night and her scheduled basal delivery was turning off/on in an alternating pattern (the blue pattern area). Blood glucose wasn't concerning nor were alarms going off. However, this combination of data is a great indicator that basal rates need to be decreased. The tendency could be to let Loop just keep plodding along like this, but it can lead to certain less than desirable stress points on the algorithm.</p> <p>Firstly, if the user were to bolus while carrying a lot of negative iob, they would get more of a bolus than otherwise needed...yes, Loop will likely suspend again as soon the meal began because blood glucose spike would be well contained with the extra bolus, but the system would just have a harder time that it should with well tuned settings. </p> <p>Secondly, if the user were to go above their correction range, they would begin to get high temporary basals for what is an inaccurate amount of negative iob (because basals really didn't need to be this high). And high temporary basals at this point in time and with these settings would be too aggressive. (If the maximum basal is set really high, the problem compounds with bad underlying settings. This is why it is a good idea to keep your maximum basal relatively low when you first start Loop and are testing your settings.)</p> <p>Useful Summary</p> <p>You probably need to lower your overnight basal rates if you wake up:</p> <ul> <li>Carrying negative IOB, and</li> <li>Blood glucose is still below or just below target, and</li> <li>Overnight basals were turning off/on.</li> </ul> <p>So, what will you see after you adjust your basal lower? You will see some of the negative IOB disappear and, as a result, the forecasted blood glucose curve will not show such an aggressive forecast for a blood glucose rebound.</p> <p>In this example,  the user's basal rates were lowered across the board. All of the basal rates went down about 0.2 U/hr. It works out to about a 15% decrease, and is pretty standard adjustment for this user due to her monthly hormone changes.</p> <p>The adjustment to basal rates caused Loop to reevaluate its math. After adjustment, Loop now has a negative IOB of -0.55 units vs the previous value of -1.33 units. This is a more reasonable given the situation. The forecast line with a -0.55 units IOB was not forecasting nearly as aggressive of a \"rebound\" blood glucose rise.</p> <p></p> <p>Why did IOB and forecast change?</p> <p>The visualization below might be easier. The red line is how loop knew things to be before basal rates were adjusted lower. The purple line is how Loop viewed basal schedule after the adjustment lower.</p> <p></p> <p>The green arrows highlight parts of the graph that are recalculated by Loop when the basal schedule was adjusted lower. Instead of Loop thinking those were NEEDED basals (aka, conforming to the old basal schedule), now Loop perceives those as \"extra basal\" insulin deliveries. Now those insulin deliveries are sitting ABOVE my scheduled basal dotted line in Nightscout. They are actually instances of positive IOB and therefore Loop is now correctly getting closer to realizing that perhaps all of that extra wasn't needed.</p> <p></p> <p>The negative/positive IOB plus a quick glance at overnight Loop actions/blood glucose relative to targets is a quick easy check on overnight basals.</p> <p>If one was really exacting, you could adjust basals until a number closer to 0 IOB. In practical use though, getting roughly closer is usually helpful enough and smaller adjustments could be made later if still needed. The graph below shows the results several hours after the basals were decreased.  As you can see, looking pretty decent.</p> <p></p> <p>The confirmation that adjustments were on-track would also be provided by looking at morning blood glucose and IOB the following morning. As you can see below, the user was at target blood glucose and carrying a very small amount of IOB. Also, there are far fewer instances of basals alternating off/on. All good signs that the basal adjustments were reasonable.</p> <p></p> <p>Note: This entire scenario can also be applied in situations where (1) blood glucose has been steady but above target and (2) Loop is holding significant positive IOB, and (3) Loop has been high temping fairly consistently.  By increasing the scheduled basals, Loop will recalculate that the positive IOB was actually necessary (not extra) insulin delivery, and the positive IOB will decrease.  This will help the forecast curve to more accurately realize that not all the insulin deliveries were being utilized as \"corrections\" but rather as needed background basal.</p>"},{"location":"how-to/low-treat/","title":"Low Treatments","text":"<p>Low blood glucose will still inevitably happen at some point, even with OS-AID use.

A little patience to give the already added insulin time to work can help with Loop.</li> <li>Edit your meal's carb entry. If you find your meal going crazy different than expected (did they forget you said \"diet\" coke?), you can always go back and edit your original carb guess to be more accurate based on what you're seeing. You can decrease the carbs or increase the carbs. You can change the absorption time. These edits can be done by tapping on the carb chart on Loop's main screen.</li> <li>Use overrides to tell Loop about overall insulin needs changing. Hormones...oh lordy the hormones are horrible. That's a good time to use an override to let Loop know that overall you need more than usual. Or if you're about to hike the Himalayas, use an override to let Loop know you will need far less insulin than an average day.</li> <li>Open Loop. This is a great tool. If you just had things go really wrong for a bit (bad cannula kink anyone?) then you can open the loop until things settle down and you get squared away again. Give your manual injection, Afreeza, or whatever your desire is, and wait until you've had 4-6 hours of regular basals going before closing the loop again.</li> <li>Give pending insulin. If you are really feeling the itch to rage bolus, you can meet Loop at the halfway mark. If you click on the bolus tool while Loop is high temping you, you will see a \"pending insulin\" value. That is the amount of insulin Loop is planning on giving you through temp basals over the next 30 minutes. If you give that pending insulin total as a bolus now, you will get the entire amount working faster AND Loop agrees you are safe to use it. In this way, Loop won't automatically suspend insulin when you give pending insulin...because your predicted glucose curve had said it was needed anyways.

What worked on a manual pump when adjusting infrequently, might not be suitable for Loop.</p> <p>Example:</p> <ul> <li>Too low a value for basal rates can be offset by regular eating of meals with too strong (lower value) carb ratio</li> <li>If you stop eating though, you'll start going high because that extra insulin from the meal boluses won't be there to offset the lack in basal rates</li> </ul> <p>Taking the time to validate your settings by truly testing them is really good practice before closing loop.</p>"},{"location":"settings/settings/#insulin-duration","title":"Insulin Duration","text":"<p>The majority of pumpers used DIA at about 3 hours on traditional pump therapy.\u00a0There's a reason for that. \u00a0In traditional pumps, a simple linear model is used to estimate the decay in effectiveness of the insulin already delivered. And it is true that after 3 or 4 hours, insulin is not affecting glucose as much as initially. But the true biological lifetime of insulin has a long tail. Insulin from more than 5 hours ago is still making a small decrease in your glucose. Loop takes that into account using a realistic model for insulin effectiveness.</p> <p>In your traditional pump, the DIA, using a linear model, was used to give a correction because blood glucose is stuck high or going low...in other words, DIA was used as a rough approximation to correct off-target blood glucose. It doesn't have to be rocket science then since we're making an approximation because some other numbers (carbohydrate count, basal rates, ISF, etc) weren't behaving the way we were expecting either and therefore leading to an off-target blood glucose.</p> <p>With the release of Loop 3, all insulin types use a realistic model, so you will not be selecting a DIA. These models help prevent insulin stacking as you begin Loop. You can read more about insulin models and how they help determine the active insulin over time in the LoopDocs: Algorithm pages.</p> <p>With Loop 3, you will select the Insulin Type you use, such as Novalog, Humalog, Apidra, Fiasp or Lyumjev. Each is associated with the appropriate exponential model for onset and peak action times.</p>"},{"location":"settings/settings/#basal-rates","title":"Basal Rates","text":"<p>Basal rates are the keystone of your therapy settings. Establishing a quality basal schedule is setting yourself up for successful looping. Personally, we find testing basal rates can be pretty painless and doesn't require days of fasting. Instead, look for easy opportunities.\u00a0If you are willing to open-loop test, that is going to give the most accurate information in the quickest way.</p> <p>It's a pretty easy test. Turn off your loop or open loop. Don't eat food, don't do crazy exercise, don't sit in a hot tub. Just have a relaxing average time period and see if your basal rates are able to hold you roughly steady. It doesn't matter if you are at target or not; the idea is to simply have zero extra active insulin from any boluses or corrections and watch what happens during those hours. Typically you would want to see about 3-4 hours of blood glucose without the influence of food boluses or activity. You can even try this tip: Loop and Learn: Basal Testing in Closed Loop</p> <p>Many people, especially little kids, are not enthusiastic about fasting basal testing...so look for opportunities to make it less cumbersome if you have to eat during the test. For example, use a low carb meal/snack that you know how to bolus for (or doesn't need a bolus at all) and generally needs no corrections.\u00a0For us, that's two extra large scrambled eggs (or three small ones) with cheese\u00a0bolused at 8g.\u00a0If she eats that meal, the blood glucose response is slow and measured. Three hours after that meal, the bolus and food effects are really muted and we can start watching to see if blood glucose stayed pretty steady.  For example, here's some of a recent open-loop basal testing we did and confirmed that blood glucose could stay pretty steady without the involvement of temporary basal help from looping.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"settings/settings/#insulin-sensitivity-factor","title":"Insulin Sensitivity Factor","text":"<p>Insulin sensitivity factor (ISF) is the next logical setting to test.\u00a0If you've just done the basal test and gotten steady blood glucose with an open loop, try taking a glucose tab or two. Wait for your blood glucose to be steady at the higher value, and give a safe correction that you think will get you close to target. Watch the resulting blood glucose drop over the next 3-4 hours. You should see blood glucose come to a steady level again. How much did the blood glucose drop? How many units of insulin did you use? Divide the two numbers and you will have your ISF. \u00a0If your glucose dropped 15 mg/dL\u00a0with half a unit of insulin, your ISF is approximately 30 mg/dL per unit.</p> <p>Testing ISF is an important step in successful closed Loop use. ISF is used in every Loop calculation and plays an important part in Loop's prediction curve. Most users find that they have to adjust ISF; most often increasing the value. If you are experiencing roller coastering blood glucose, as described below, that is often a sign that ISF needs to be weaker (higher value).</p> <p>Before you read the next part, let's clear up some definitions and terms:</p> <p>Insulin sensitivity factor described just that...how sensitive your blood glucose is to the effect of insulin. If your blood glucose doesn't drop much when you put in insulin and you have to use a lot, your insulin sensitivity is \"weak\". If your blood glucose drops quickly and you don't need much insulin to correct a high blood glucose, your insulin sensitivity is \"strong\".</p> <p>The terminology gets confusing sometimes because some people think of the terms \"weak\" and \"strong\" in terms of how Loop's actions will behave.  If you make your ISF value greater (i.e., changing it from 50 to 55), you are weakening the magnitude of Loop's adjustments because you are telling Loop that your sensitivity to insulin is stronger...you don't need as much to correct a high blood glucose and suspensions will have a tendency to rebound more.</p> <p>In order to avoid the confusion that surrounds the words \"weak\" and \"strong\", instead we will describe the actual adjustment to the ISF value...the number itself.</p> <p>If your ISF is set to a value that is too low compared to what it really should be, one of the most common symptoms you'll see is a roller coaster of blood glucose where the insulin adjustments are cycling between zero\u00a0basal and strong high temporary rates (or automatic boluses).\u00a0Here are some example graphs from Looped group.\u00a0These are examples where too low\u00a0of ISF is more than likely a large factor in the roller coaster\u00a0(doesn't mean it is the only culprit, and is more difficult to ferret out when food is involved like the second graph). Lightning bolt high temporary basals followed by very quick blood glucose drops and zero temps is usually too low of ISF value...raise the ISF value (e.g., go from 50 to 55) to help Loop know that each unit of insulin is actually having more impact than you'd previously thought. Making changes of about 10% for a setting is reasonable to try; just make sure you are changing it in the correct direction - remember: a lower number = more insulin; a higher number = less insulin.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p>"},{"location":"settings/settings/#carb-ratios","title":"Carb Ratios","text":"<p>Now that you have basals and ISF set, here's where it gets really tempting to close loop and move on. And, truthfully, it's not that hard to test carb ratios on a closed loop vs an open loop if you've solidly tested all these other factors.</p> <p>A good carb ratio will bring your blood glucose, for an average meal, back to the starting point of the meal within about 3 hours or so.</p> <p>A bad carb ratio will leave you higher or lower than the starting point of the meal.</p> <p>For example, this graph shows too aggressive of a carb ratio (value too low). \u00a0Three hours after the meal, there's nearly 0.50 units of active insulin, blood glucose is well below where the meal started, and definitely low treatments needed.</p> <p></p> <p>If you are finding that a correct carb ratio is yielding good blood glucose 3 hours later, but you aren't happy with the peak blood glucose during the meal, then it may be time to explore increasing or adding prebolusing time to your meal or implementing \"eating soon\" targets an hour before meals to help control the post-meal blood glucose spike.\u00a0Artificially strengthening carb ratios to help control post-meal blood glucose spike will likely yield lows 2-3 hours after a meal.</p>"}]}
