A blood glucose device (such as a glucose meter) is used to calibrate the CGM.</p> <p>A computer-controlled algorithm connects the CGM and insulin infusion pump to allow continuous communication between the two devices. Sometimes an artificial pancreas device system is referred to as a \"closed-loop\" system, an \"automated insulin delivery\" system, or an \"autonomous system for glycemic control.\"</p> <p>An Artificial Pancreas Device System will not only monitor glucose levels in the body but also automatically adjust the delivery of insulin to reduce high blood glucose levels (hyperglycemia) and minimize the incidence of low blood glucose (hypoglycemia) with little or no input from the patient.\"</p>"},{"location":"#what-is-loop","title":"What is Loop?","text":"<p>The Loop app is a do-it-yourself closed loop algorithm and user interface, developed through the work of community volunteers.

These blood glucose predictions provide Loop with the information needed to recommend a temporary basal rate to attain a targeted glucose range in the future. The system can either operate as an \u201copen loop\u201d by making recommendations to the user for their approval before enacting or as a \u201cclosed loop\u201d by automatically setting the recommended temporary basal rate.</p> <p>As exciting as this sounds...we should first get the caveats out of the way.

Each day people with T1D make decisions about what and when to eat, and how much insulin to use to cover carbohydrates effect. It can be difficult to visualize what is happening throughout the day as carbohydrate absorption raises blood glucose and insulin reduces it \u2013 particularly when multiple events interact with one another.</p> <p>GlucoDyn uses calculations similar to an insulin pump\u2019s bolus wizard to create graphs of blood glucose versus time, based on your inputs of carb and insulin events. The user can enter carbohydrates, boluses, and temporary basals, and GlucoDyn calculates the effect on blood glucose over time. GlucoDyn also allows the user to \u201cslide\u201d the events around once they have been entered \u2013 allowing you to see what would have happened to your blood glucose curve if you had bolused earlier or eaten a different amount of carbohydrates \u201con the fly\u201d \u2013 the curves change as you move the sliders.</p> <p>Seeing the curves and understanding the effects of bolus timing, carbohydrate absorption rate glycemic index (GI) value, temporary basal timing and rates, etc. can help users with their overall understanding of T1D and its management.</p> <p>Originally, Loop used the same carbohydrate absorption and insulin models as Glucodyn uses. Those have since been updated in Loop with dynamic carbohydrate absorption and exponential curves for insulin. Even with those changes, the GlucoDyn tool can still provide users an excellent tool to visualize how small changes in bolusing can affect trends in blood glucose. For example, it\u2019s quite interesting to see the effect of pre-bolusing. By delaying the carb intake by say 20 minutes, you can visualize the reduction of the maximum blood glucose. But, you have to be careful \u2013 before the carbohydrates have time to absorb insulin is working, and the minimum blood glucose will also drop. These are the kinds of tradeoffs that are critical to the management of T1D, and thankfully are automated by Loop's smart bolusing based on carbohydrate absorption estimates.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"data/health/","title":"Health App","text":""},{"location":"data/health/#overview-of-healthkit-and-health","title":"Overview of HealthKit and Health","text":"<p>There's often confusion over the terminology surrounding Apple's health data storage so let's start there.</p> <ul> <li>HealthKit -- Apple's iOS database for storing health-related data.

Therefore, you should disable other apps from writing carbohydrate data to HealthKit so that Loop does not read those other entries unintentionally.  Also, good practice, because carbohydrate entries in HealthKit that were created by non-Loop apps will not be able to customize carbohydrate absorption times nor be edited later if needed.</p>"},{"location":"data/health/#your-use-of-health-app","title":"Your use of Health App","text":"<p>Summaries of your carbohydrates, insulin, and blood glucose results can be found by clicking on the Health Data at the bottom bar, and then selecting either the large Nutrition box (for carbohydrates) or smaller Results line (for insulin deliveries and blood glucose results).</p> <p></p> <p>If you toggle on the \"add to favorites\" slider for the individual data categories (insulin, blood glucose, carbohydrates), the data from those categories will be added to your Today view for easy quick reference and access.</p> <p></p> <p>The summary data for the categories can help you follow monthly trends, help identify periods of insulin sensitivity/resistance, evaluate total daily insulin use, breakdown of basal rate vs bolus insulin, and carbohydrate consumption.

Because of Loop use, a clinic currently has to look at separate reports from Medtronic pump, Contour Next Link BG meter, Dexcom CGM/Clarity, and our iPhone Health app, as a typical example. There are also a couple of issues with Loop when using this separate download method:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Medtronic\u2019s pump gets so clogged up by the numerous temporary basal rate records being recorded that the clinic can only pull about 7 days of data from the pump at most.</p> </li> <li> <p>Clinic basically lacks an overlay of basal rate/bolus actions with blood glucose from Dexcom, which really limits their ability to recommend any settings changes.  </p> </li> <li> <p>DIY solutions could fill some of the gaps as far as overall management, but the problem was with the actual gathering of the reports.

Complex carbohydrates are slowed by their fat and protein content and can lead to extended time of blood glucose impacts. Many people with type 1 are familiar with the late blood glucose spikes from Chinese food, pasta, pizza, or burritos. This extended blood glucose impact can be tricky to properly bolus for in traditional one-bolus insulin delivery.</p> <p>In traditional multiple daily injection therapy, these complex meals may require additional insulin boluses to help control long, slow absorption meals. The trick is to try to time the second bolus at a time when blood glucose is starting to rise and it can be tricky to estimate how much to give to control the tail end of those slow meals.</p> <p>If you're using traditional pump therapy, one technique is to use an extended bolus or dual wave bolus for your complex meal's insulin. In this method, a user give a portion of the insulin up front as an initial bolus and the remainder of the insulin is delivered as a pseudo high temp basal for a user-set duration of time. For example, you may give 5 units of bolus up-front and then \"extend\" 4 units of insulin over the next 60 minutes. In this way, you are providing a more complex bolus to help match the timing of the meal's blood glucose impacts; avoiding early low blood glucose and addressing later high blood glucose.</p> <p>The transition to Loop use may be confusing at first for these meals since you cannot use an extended/combo bolus and simultaneously have Loop set temporary basals automatically. The good news is that Loop has a bolus calculator that has the ability to emulate an extended bolus situation...and it's implemented with the pizza icon (or any custom carbohydrate absorption that is set longer than 4 hours).</p>"},{"location":"how-to/bolus/#pizza-icon","title":"Pizza Icon","text":""},{"location":"how-to/bolus/#example-long-absorption-time-bolus","title":"Example long absorption time bolus","text":"<p>For an example of Loop's bolus adjustments using carbohydrate absorption time, let's take a look at an example meal.  This is an example of a long absorption complex carbohydrate meal. This is a mushroom (arborio) risotto dish with heavy cream and cheese ingredients. While some white rice can be fairly quick acting, after several times eating this dish, the family has noticed that the meal tends to have a longer duration of impact on blood glucose. Using a \"taco\" icon (3 hours absorption) was causing slight low blood glucose soon after eating the meal. Therefore, they have been using the pizza icon to enter the meal's carbohydrate absorption time.</p> <p></p> <p>The initial meal entry was 70g at a \"pizza\" icon absorption time (4 hours). Based on a carbohydrate ratio of 8 g/U, the initial bowl of risotto at 60g should have been a bolus of 7.5 units. Loop recommended 5.3 units or about 70% of the total bolus that would be needed to cover the total carbohydrates. Loop recommended the lower upfront bolus because a full bolus would have overwhelmed the slow absorption of carbohydrates, and the likelihood would be a low blood glucose shortly after eating. </p> <p>As the meal was being absorbed, Loop was tracking the carbohydrates still remaining to be absorbed and expecting that blood glucose values would be rising soon (knowing that there was still insulin needing to be delivered once safely passed the near-meal low blood glucose potential). Loop would have provided the additional insulin via high temporary basals after seeing blood glucose impacts which indicated the potential for a low blood glucose had passed. </p> <p>The Loop user then had a second, smaller bowl of risotto about 90 minutes later, and entered 30g at 4 hours absorption again. Notice this bowl of risotto had a bolus recommendation much different than the original bowl. The second bowl had a recommendation of 5 units, much greater amount of bolus relative to the amount of carbs entered than the first bowl had received, and more than the carbohydrate ratio alone would provide (3.75 units). Why the \"extra\" 1.25 units? Because Loop was including some extra bolus amount to cover what it predicted could safely be provided from the amount not given in the original bowl's bolus (the original bolus was approximately 2.2 units short of the carbohydrate ratio alone recommendation). If the user had not had the second bowl, Loop would have been providing high temporary basals as soon as blood glucose had exceeded the correction range. And in fact, you can see that Loop still provided the remaining insulin via high temporary basals as blood glucose rose after the second bowl, in effect making up the small remaining difference.</p>"},{"location":"how-to/bolus/#low-carbhigh-fat-or-keto-diets","title":"Low carb/High Fat or Keto diets","text":"<p>The example meal above, while relatively high carbohydrate, also helps illustrate how Loop can be used to bolus effectively for low carb/high fat (LC/HF) or Keto diets.  Those diets tend to have low glycemic index food with a relatively long blood glucose impact.  Said another way, they don't spike blood sugar as much but often need additional insulin after the meal was eaten to account for the slow conversion of protein to glucose.</p> <p>To account for those dietary differences, there are two useful strategies:</p> <ul> <li>convert some of the protein and fat to \"equivalent carbohydrates\" and</li> <li>extend the duration of those carbohydrates using a pizza icon or even longer, depending on the person/food.</li> </ul> <p>Most LC/HF or Keto users will convert a portion of their fat and protein content into an equivalent carbohydrate content.  So while an example meal might only have 5g of carbohydrates based on nutritional labels, they may convert 25% of the 20g fat and 50% of the 20g protein grams into an additional 15g of \"equivalent carbs\" for bolusing purposes.

The CGM noise immediately decreased after the first calibration was provided at the noon-time meal bolus.

Showers, some sports activities, swimming, and medical exams are some of the common reasons when disconnections are unavoidable.</p> <p>The simplest way to deal with periods of disconnect is to suspend the Medtronic pump so that Loop knows no insulin was being delivered while you were disconnected. This will let Loop know that there is missing basal insulin that may need to be considered as part of the blood glucose prediction. Typically when disconnected from insulin delivery and negative insulin on board has developed, blood glucose will start to rise so Loop will expect to need to make up the missed insulin from disconnections.</p> <p>Some users are prone to forget to resume insulin delivery after suspending for disconnects.  One option is to use Siri by simply saying \"Hey Siri, set a timer for 30 minutes\" and that can serve as a reminder alarm to resume the pump after the shower is over. Other users may want to consider canceling any running temporary basal, setting a 30 minute zero temporary basal, and then setting Loop to open loop.  This will keep IOB fairly accurate while at the same time providing an automatic restart of normal basals if the user forgets to resume delivery.

The best approach is to start with objective information. Find out if the clinic has other patients already Looping and whether or not they have concerns from what they have seen. Provide links to the LoopDocs site and this site so that your endocrinologist or health care provider can read about the system's algorithm and operations.</p> <p>Most often the important aspects that need discussion are:</p> <ul> <li>Loop will revert to normal pump use, within a maximum of 30 minutes, in the event of Loop failure.  What happens during failure of the system is the most common concern your health care provider will likely have when initially learning about the system.</li> <li>Loop depends on your basal rate, ISF, and carbohydrate ratio settings, just like traditional pump therapy. The conversations will not need to change regarding the evaluation and adequacy of those settings.</li> <li>Duration of insulin action is automatically set to 6-hours for the rapid-acting insulin models built into Loop, matching published data for those insulins. The settings in the pump for duration of insulin action are not used by Loop.</li> <li>Reasonable values for the suspend threshold and maximum basal rate should be discussed.  These two settings are not part of normal pump therapy and should be discussed with your endocrinologist. Typically to start Looping, setting the maximum basal rate not much above your highest scheduled basal rate is an excellent way to get used to Loop and safely double-check that your settings (ISF, carbohydrate ratio, and basal schedule) are reasonably accurate.  As you gain experience and confirm your settings, raising the maximum basal rate can help Loop become more effective to correct rising blood glucose more quickly.</li> <li>Develop a plan for how you will be providing Loop data to your health care provider in advance.  Ask what information they would like to review so that you can have reports ready at each appointment.

Highlighted in orange above are parts of those recommendations and considerations that we should explore a little more for Loop in particular:</p> <p>Risk for hypoglycemia can be reduced by avoiding too much insulin on board (IOB) during and after exercise. -- In Loop use, we can accomplish this through setting a workout target far enough ahead of the exercise to help decrease basal insulin on board going into exercise. Typically this means setting a workout target at least 1, if not 2, hours prior to exercise. Setting a workout target just as you begin a workout will not allow sufficient time to decrease IOB ahead of an aerobic workout. Loop workout targets are usually 50 mg/dL higher than your usual correction target, although that is a guide. Practice and observation of your typical exercise needs will help refine your optimal settings. And while not Loop specific, minimize heavy carb meals in the 3 hours before intense exercise that would require large boluses. If eating during that time, consider partial boluses and slower, lower carbohydrate snacks. If bolusing while workout targets are enacted, Loop will automatically recommend a smaller bolus than you would get with your normal correction target.</p> <p>After most exercise, insulin sensitivity is higher for up to 24 hours.

Check if you are (1) above, below, or within target range and (2) carrying significant positive or negative IOB in the morning before you start walking around (if you are prone to dawn phenomenon) or eating. Since mornings are free from food influence, these are almost like waking up from a mini-basal testing every overnight. </p> <p>This Looped group post started the conversation:</p> <p> </p> <p>I've been having more lows recently than I would like. Any help here would be really really appreciated.</p> <p>I took a screenshot of an example situation...LOOP is predicting that I'll eventually rise up to 124 and is therefore giving me my full regular basal rate EVEN THOUGH im currently way below my desired goal range. I have a better knowledge of my diabetes than LOOP does (sorry if that is heresy around here) and I would not like LOOP to be giving me basal right now OR ELSE I'LL GO LOW.</p> <p>QUESTION: Which parameter must I change on my loop settings in order to essentially tell LOOP to relax on the basal rates??</p> <p></p> <p>To illustrate how to use morning IOB and blood glucose to check your basal rates, we will walk through a series of screenshots from a recent Loop experience. When the Looper woke up, she was below her 95 mg/dL target, but relatively steady. At about 8:48am, Nightscout showed negative IOB of -1.33 units, blood glucose of 90 mg/dL and slightly rising but still below a target of 95 mg/dL. (Note: this situation is similar to what the original Facebook poster above was describLooped2](ing.)</p> <p></p> <p>Looking back on the night, blood glucose was pretty much below target the whole night and her scheduled basal delivery was turning off/on in an alternating pattern (the blue pattern area). Blood glucose wasn't concerning nor were alarms going off. However, this combination of data is a great indicator that basal rates need to be decreased. The tendency could be to let Loop just keep plodding along like this, but it can lead to certain less than desirable stress points on the algorithm.</p> <p>Firstly, if the user were to bolus while carrying a lot of negative iob, they would get more of a bolus than otherwise needed...yes, Loop will likely suspend again as soon the meal began because blood glucose spike would be well contained with the extra bolus, but the system would just have a harder time that it should with well tuned settings. </p> <p>Secondly, if the user were to go above their correction range, they would begin to get high temporary basals for what is an inaccurate amount of negative iob (because basals really didn't need to be this high). And high temporary basals at this point in time and with these settings would be too aggressive. (If the maximum basal is set really high, the problem compounds with bad underlying settings. This is why it is a good idea to keep your maximum basal relatively low when you first start Loop and are testing your settings.)</p> <p>Useful Summary</p> <p>You probably need to lower your overnight basal rates if you wake up:</p> <ul> <li>Carrying negative IOB, and</li> <li>Blood glucose is still below or just below target, and</li> <li>Overnight basals were turning off/on.</li> </ul> <p>So, what will you see after you adjust your basal lower? You will see some of the negative IOB disappear and, as a result, the predicted blood glucose curve will not so such an aggressive prediction for a blood glucose rebound.</p> <p>In this example,  the user's basal rates were lowered across the board. All of the basal rates went down about 0.2 U/hr. It works out to about a 15% decrease, and is pretty standard adjustment for this user due to her monthly hormone changes.</p> <p>The adjustment to basal rates caused Loop to reevaluate its math. After adjustment, Loop now has a negative IOB of -0.55 units vs the previous value of -1.33 units. This is a more reasonable given the situation. The prediction line with a -0.55 units IOB was not predicting nearly as aggressive of a \"rebound\" blood glucose rise.</p> <p></p> <p>Why did IOB and prediction change?</p> <p>The visualization below might be easier. The red line is how loop knew things to be before basal rates were adjusted lower. The purple line is how Loop viewed basal schedule after the adjustment lower.</p> <p></p> <p>The green arrows highlight parts of the graph that are recalculated by Loop when the basal schedule was adjusted lower. Instead of Loop thinking those were NEEDED basals (aka, conforming to the old basal schedule), now Loop perceives those as \"extra basal\" insulin deliveries. Now those insulin deliveries are sitting ABOVE my scheduled basal dotted line in Nightscout. They are actually instances of positive IOB and therefore Loop is now correctly getting closer to realizing that perhaps all of that extra wasn't needed.</p> <p></p> <p>The negative/positive IOB plus a quick glance at overnight Loop actions/blood glucose relative to targets is a quick easy check on overnight basals.</p> <p>If one was really exacting, you could adjust basals until a number closer to 0 IOB. In practical use though, getting roughly closer is usually helpful enough and smaller adjustments could be made later if still needed. The graph below shows the results several hours after the basals were decreased.  As you can see, looking pretty decent.</p> <p></p> <p>The confirmation that adjustments were on-track would also be provided by looking at morning blood glucose and IOB the following morning. As you can see below, the user was at target blood glucose and carrying a very small amount of IOB. Also, there are far fewer instances of basals alternating off/on. All good signs that the basal adjustments were reasonable.</p> <p></p> <p>Note: This entire scenario can also be applied in situations where (1) blood glucose has been steady but above target and (2) Loop is holding significant positive IOB, and (3) Loop has been high temping fairly consistently.  By increasing the scheduled basals, Loop will recalculate that the positive IOB was actually necessary (not extra) insulin delivery, and the positive IOB will decrease.  This will help the prediction curve to more accurately realize that not all the insulin deliveries were being utilized as \"corrections\" but rather as needed background basal.</p>"},{"location":"how-to/low-treat/","title":"Low Treatments","text":"<p>Low blood glucose will still inevitably happen at some point, even with Loop use.

The recommendations and actions that Loop takes are based on that algorithm, and the settings you enter in your Loop app are the basis for that math.</p> <p>Let's start by thinking about basal rates.  A well-adjusted basal schedule is designed to keep your blood glucose steady throughout the day, everything else being equal. If you were to not eat, not exercise, and basically keep a mellow lifestyle...basals should keep your blood glucose steady.  </p> <p>That is how Loop's math starts, and it's an important point to remember as you use and learn your Loop app.  Loop's math is based on the assumption that the basal schedule you have provided in your settings are capable of keeping your blood glucose steady in the absence of other stressors.  So as your blood glucose goes higher than your correction range for an unusual short-term influence like stress or unannounced carbs, you've been accustomed to delivering a \"correction bolus\" to get back to range. Or if blood glucose goes below your correction range, you may need to eat recovery carbohydrates.</p> <p>With all the excitement about automated insulin delivery, some people mistakenly assume that the user's settings don't matter anymore....that everything is automated. However, settings do still matter as they provide the basis for Loop's math.  Diabetes is not a static math equation. Loop does not adjust your settings for you, that responsibility still falls to the Loop user when needed.</p> <p>Let's give some examples to help.  When you calculate a meal bolus, your math probably looks similar to this:</p> <p></p> <p>But many times you are probably adjusting that math based on any number of \"factors\" that you are aware could be affecting your blood glucose. Diatribe put together this great list of factors that affect blood glucose, and therefore could also affect how you'd adjust your insulin delivery from what they otherwise would normally be.</p> <p></p> <p>Some of those factors you are already used to making allowances for, such as:</p> <ul> <li>Pizza boluses...You probably are accustomed to needing an extended bolus and/or higher temporary basal rate to help with the late blood glucose spike common after the initial bolus starts to wear off.  That pizza takes a long time to digest thanks to those slow-acting fats.  </li> <li>Medications...How about that time that you had to take steroids for an achy joint?  Those steroids probably resulted in a dramatic overall increase in insulin needs for several days, and you had to set aggressive temporary basal increases or other settings adjustments.</li> <li>Hormones...monthly hormone cycles have many women adjusting their basal rates and/or insulin sensitivity schedules for a week or so each month.</li> <li>Exercise...always a tough one because some exercise may make your blood glucose rise (lifting weights) and other exercise may make your blood glucose drop (running).  Through repetition, most people have learned how to adjust for exercise by using temporary basal rates or timing of meals/boluses.</li> </ul> <p>The degree to which Loop can deal with those stresses/factors is largely dependent on the duration of the \"factor\" itself and how well we can communicate to Loop that those factors are at play.  For things we know are coming, we can tell Loop in advance, and Loop has ways of dealing with them mathematically.  In the pizza example, Loop lets us mark the meal as long, slow digestion, and therefore better react to a potential late blood glucose rise.  For exercise, we can use temporary override blood glucose targets before/after exercise to help Loop administer less insulin for awhile.</p> <p>If, however, your insulin needs are impacted by something more long term such as hormone cycles, medications, or illness then sometimes your  Loop  may not be able to consistently hold you at your desired blood glucose.  You may end up holding steady at a higher/lower blood glucose than you'd prefer.  This is because Loop's math is still using the inputs that were from before you got sick/stressed/hormone'd (new word).

For much of the time, the stressors in type 1 are short-lived and temporary (we just ride them out)...carbohydrate count is a little off, math test in algebra class, public speaking engagement, etc.  Loop does well helping with the short-term stressors.  They don't represent a prolonged need to change settings and the blood glucose impacts are short-lived as Loop corrects for them.</p> <p>However, the longer term stressors are often helped by settings adjustments.  Examples of longer term stressors are medications, illness, hormones, travel, or altitude.   By letting Loop know that the status quo has changed (more/less insulin is needed overall) will help BGs get and stay in range.  If you have told Loop that your insulin need is 1 unit/hour, but in reality, you're needing 1.3 units/hour because you've traveled to a colder place and will be sedentary for days...you will likely find yourself steady but higher than your target range while Looping.  The high temporary basals that Loop will be providing in an attempt to bring you back to target will simply be going to fill the lack of adequate basal scheduled.

Insulin from more than 5 hours ago is still making a small decrease in your glucose. Loop takes that into account using a realistic model for insulin effectiveness.</p> <p>In your traditional pump, the DIA, using a linear model, was used to give a correction because blood glucose is stuck high or going low...in other words, DIA was used as a rough approximation to correct off-target blood glucose.

Turn off your loop or open loop. Don't eat food, don't do crazy exercise, don't sit in a hot tub. Just have a relaxing average time period and see if your basal rates are able to hold you roughly steady. It doesn't matter if you are at target or not; the idea is to simply have zero extra active insulin from any boluses or corrections and watch what happens during those hours.

You can even try this tip: Loop and Learn: Basal Testing in Closed Loop</p> <p>Many people, especially little kids, are not enthusiastic about fasting basal testing...so look for opportunities to make it less cumbersome if you have to eat during the test.

Wait for your blood glucose to be steady at the higher value, and give a safe correction that you think will get you close to target. Watch the resulting blood glucose drop over the next 3-4 hours. You should see blood glucose come to a steady level again. How much did the blood glucose drop? How many units of insulin did you use?

If your blood glucose doesn't drop much when you put in insulin and you have to use a lot, your insulin sensitivity is \"weak\". If your blood glucose drops quickly and you don't need much insulin to correct a high blood glucose, your insulin sensitivity is \"strong\".</p> <p>The terminology gets confusing sometimes because some people think of the terms \"weak\" and \"strong\" in terms of how Loop's actions will behave.  If you make your ISF value greater (i.e., changing it from 50 to 55), you are weakening the magnitude of Loop's adjustments because you are telling Loop that your sensitivity to insulin is stronger...you don't need as much to correct a high blood glucose and suspensions will have a tendency to rebound more.</p> <p>In order to avoid the confusion that surrounds the words \"weak\" and \"strong\", instead we will describe the actual adjustment to the ISF value...the number itself.</p> <p>If your ISF is set to a value that is too low compared to what it really should be, one of the most common symptoms you'll see is a roller coaster of blood glucose where the insulin adjustments are cycling between zero\u00a0basal and strong high temporary rates (or automatic boluses).\u00a0Here are some example graphs from Looped group.\u00a0These are examples where too low\u00a0of ISF is more than likely a large factor in the roller coaster\u00a0(doesn't mean it is the only culprit, and is more difficult to ferret out when food is involved like the second graph). Lightning bolt high temporary basals followed by very quick blood glucose drops and zero temps is usually too low of ISF value...raise the ISF value (e.g., go from 50 to 55) to help Loop know that each unit of insulin is actually having more impact than you'd previously thought.
